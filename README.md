Hello,

These are my Telerik Academy Homeworks and Projects

==================
JavaScript Part 1
==================

You can see the source of my JavaScript code by clicking the relevant HTML file

-OR-

You can also run HTML files directly with tool called "GitHub HTML Preview".
Just prepend "http://htmlpreview.github.com/?" /without quotes/ to the URL of any HTML file 
or you can copy HTML URL here - http://htmlpreview.github.com/ - and run it. 

Example:
http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/VLADominator/JS-Part-I/blob/master/06.%20Arrays/01.%20MultiplyAnArrayElementsBy5.html



Best regards,

Vladimir Vasilev
